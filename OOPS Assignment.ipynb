What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that organizes it into \"objects.\" An object is like a mini-program that groups data (like variables) and actions (like functions) together. OOP makes it easier to build and manage complex programs by modeling things in the real world.\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n","-> A class in OOP is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n","-> An object in OOP is an instance of a class — a real, usable thing created from a class blueprint. It has its own values for the properties defined in the class and can use the class's methods.\n","\n","4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","-> Abstraction: Hides complex details, shows only what’s needed. Focus on what an object does.\n","→ Example: Driving a car without knowing how the engine works.\n","\n","Encapsulation: Hides data, controls access with methods. Protects the object’s state.\n","→ Example: Speed is changed with pedals, not directly tweaking the engine.\n","\n","Abstraction = Hide complexity, Encapsulation = Protect data.\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","-> Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) in Python are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores, like __init__. They let you define how objects of your class behave in certain situations.\n","\n","example:\n","> __init__: Initializes the object.\n","> __str__: Defines how the object looks as a string.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","-> Inheritance in OOP lets one class (child) take on properties and methods from another class (parent). It helps reuse code and build relationships between classes.\n","example: Animal is the parent class.\n","Dog is the child class, inheriting from Animal.\n","Inheritance saves code and builds connections between classes.\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","-> Polymorphism means one action can work in different ways, depending on the object. It lets us use the same method name for different types of objects.Same method, different behavior.\n","\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","->Encapsulation in Python is achieved by keeping data private and controlling access through methods. You use underscores to set variable visibility:\n","\n","Private: Use double underscore __ to hide variables.\n","Protected: Use single underscore _ as a convention (not strictly private, but signals \"for internal use\").\n","Public: No underscore — accessible everywhere.\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","-> A constructor in Python is a special method that automatically runs when you create an object. It sets up the object with initial values. A constructor sets up an object when it’s created.\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","-> In Python, class methods and static methods are special methods that you can call without creating an object.\n","1. Class Method:\n","Works with the class itself, not instances.\n","Uses @classmethod decorator.\n","Takes cls as the first parameter (refers to the class).\n","2. Static Method:\n","Doesn’t access class or instance data.\n","Uses @staticmethod decorator.\n","No self or cls needed — just like a regular function inside a class.\n","\n","Quick difference:\n","\n","Class methods interact with class variables.\n","Static methods are independent utility functions within a class.\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","-> Method overloading in Python means defining multiple methods with the same name but different arguments. Python doesn’t support true method overloading like some other languages, but you can achieve it using default arguments. Python handles overloading with flexible parameters.\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","-> Method overriding in OOP happens when a child class provides its own version of a method that already exists in the parent class. This lets the child class change or extend the method’s behavior. Overriding replaces a parent method with a child’s version\n","\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","-> In Python, a property decorator (@property) makes a method act like an attribute! It lets us access methods without calling them like functions, adding a layer of control when getting or setting values. Property decorators manage access to class attributes.\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","-> Polymorphism is super important in OOP because it makes your code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain! Here’s\n","Reasons are:\n","Simplifies code: You can write one function to work with different types of objects.\n","Promotes reusability: The same interface works for multiple classes, so you don’t repeat code.\n","Enhances flexibility: You can add new classes without changing existing code, as long as they follow the same method structure.\n","\n","Polymorphism makes our code adaptable and future-proof.\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","-> An abstract class in Python is like a blueprint for other classes. It defines methods that must be implemented by any subclass. We can’t create objects from an abstract class — it just sets the rules. We create abstract classes using the abc module.\n","Key points:\n","Abstract class: Defined with ABC (Abstract Base Class).\n","Abstract method: Marked with @abstractmethod — must be implemented in child classes.\n","No direct objects: You can’t instantiate an abstract class itself.\n","Abstract classes define structure but leave the details to subclasses.\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comes with some awesome advantages are:\n","1. Reusability: Use the same code across different parts of your program with classes and inheritance.\n","2. Modularity: Split your program into smaller, manageable pieces (classes).\n","Maintainability: Easier to update and fix because you can modify individual classes without breaking the whole program.\n","3. Data security: Protect data with encapsulation (private attributes & controlled access).\n","4. Flexibility & scalability: Handle different data types and behaviors with polymorphism.\n","5. Real-world modeling: Map complex real-world scenarios into classes and objects, making code more intuitive.\n","\n","Example: A Car class with properties like color and speed, and methods like drive and brake — just like a real car...\n","\n","OOP makes code more organized, reusable, and closer to real-life concepts.\n","\n","17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","-> The difference between a class variable and an instance variable are:\n","\n","Class Variable:\n","Shared across all instances of the class.\n","Defined outside of any methods, right in the class.\n","Changing it affects every object of that class.\n","\n","Instance Variable:\n","Unique to each object.\n","Defined inside the __init__ method (with self).\n","Changing it only affects that object.\n","\n","Class variable = shared data for all objects.\n","Instance variable = unique data for each objec\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","-> Multiple inheritance in Python lets a class inherit from more than one parent class. This means the child class gets the properties and methods of all its parent classes. Multiple inheritance combines features from multiple classes into one.\n","\n","19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n","-> In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are dunder (double underscore) methods that control how your object is represented as a string. Let’s break it down.\n","\n","__str__ (For Users):\n","Returns a human-readable string (informal, pretty).\n","Meant to be helpful for end-users.\n","Used with print() or str().\n","\n","__str__: User-friendly output (like a label).\n","\n","__repr__ (For Developers):\n","Returns an official string representation.\n","Meant for debugging and development.\n","Should return a string that could recreate the object.\n","Used with repr() or in the interactive console.\n","\n","__repr__: Debug-friendly output (like a blueprint).\n","\n","20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","-> The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent class. It’s especially useful in inheritance because it lets you reuse the parent class's methods without directly naming the parent.\n","super() calls parent methods or constructors.\n","Helps in extending or modifying inherited behavior.\n","\n","21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","-> The __del__ method in Python is a destructor — it’s called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (like when it goes out of scope or is deleted). It lets you run cleanup code, such as closing files or releasing resources. __del__ helps clean up resources when an object is destroyed.\n","\n","22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","-> n Python, @staticmethod and @classmethod define methods that you can call on a class without creating an object.\n","\n","@staticmethod (No Access to Class or Instance):\n","Independent function inside a class.\n","No access to class or instance variables.\n","Doesn’t need self or cls.\n","\n","@staticmethod: No class or object access — just a regular function inside a class.\n","\n","@classmethod (Access to Class, Not Instance):\n","Works with the class itself, not an object.\n","Takes cls as the first parameter (not self).\n","Can modify class-level variables.\n","\n","@classmethod: Works with the class itself (via cls), can change class variables.\n","\n","23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","-> In Python, polymorphism with inheritance means that child classes can have methods with the same name as in the parent class, but with their own unique behavior. This lets you use a single interface to interact with different types of objects. Polymorphism lets us use a common method name to interact with different types of objects, making your code more flexible and scalable.\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","-> Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after the other. For this to work, each method needs to return the object itself (usually with return self). Method chaining makes your code more fluent and compact, especially useful for builders, data processing, or configurations.\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","-> In Python, the __call__ method makes an object callable like a function! If you define __call__ in a class, you can create an object and then call it with parentheses, just like a regular function. __call__ turns an object into a callable function! It gives you the power of functions with the structure of classes.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NoDyxYRh8gdV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"iLu6t7OwKQuE"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"PJFVnlSp8d18","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741712673735,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1367,"user":{"displayName":"Pritam Khan","userId":"03957958211476041643"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#1. .
